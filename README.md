# env-pt-br

:smile: Set up your environment and start to contribute with PHP Manual (translation into pt_BR Brazilian Portuguese)

## Why

Because contributing with PHP Manual demands some "boring" steps, and having a way to automate this process is awesome.

So **phpmanual/env-pt-br** project provides this: a `Makefile` that gives you this automation!

*Note: This one is specific for working on pt_BR Brazilian Portuguese translation. Checkout <https://github.com/phpmanual> for other available setups, or create your one based on those*

## Usage

```
# cd into_your_desired_folder
git clone https://github.com/phpmanual/env-pt-br.git
make
```

And choose the action!
